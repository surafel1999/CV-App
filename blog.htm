                <p class="title">Using Scalable Units for Responsive Site.</p>
                <article>
                    <p>
                    	Does using units such as $, em, rem increase site responsiveness? Yes, it does. Because %, em, rem all are scalable units which are translated by the user's browser into pixel values. Since, these are scalable units values are not always exactly the same pixel, which depends on the current browser setting.</p>
					<p>
                        Therefore, if the user wants to increase the size of the text, this can be done simply by using relative size on the developer's part and the browser handles the rest. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    	Furthermore, when websites are developed it should target many devices specially, mobile phones. In a nutshell, in this era of technology no matter what the device, the website should look great. This is done by using relative size.

                        Does using units such as $, em, rem increase site responsiveness? Yes, it does. Because %, em, rem all are scalable units, which are translated by the user's browser into pixel values. And since,  these are values are not absolute, which depends on the current browser setting. When the user
                        zooms the screen, the text will not as it is. Thus, zooming in increases site's font size, and zooming out decreases site's font size.</p>
                    <p>
                        Therefore, if the user wants to increase the size of the text, this can be done simply by using relative size on the developer's part and the browser handles the rest.

                    <p>
                        Furthermore, when websites are developed developers should target as many devices as possible. This is done by simply developing for mobile phones first, then make our way up to desktop. This would be holy grail or at least difficult, without using Scalable units. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In conclusion, in this era of technology no matter what the device, the website's content should be easy to read. This is easily accomplished using relative size or Scalable units.

                <p class="title">The defualt browser's font-size</p>
                <article>
                    <p>The defualt browser font-size also called base font-size is often 16px, which is the standard for proportional fonts. All scalable units are computed relative to this value. In other words, scalable units are proportional to the base font-size. Therefore, by default 1rem = 16px, and 2rem = 32px. 
                    </p>
<<<<<<< HEAD
                    <p>If one has set a font-size of 200px on the body, then all scalable units will be relative to this new value. For example, 1em will become 200px, 2rem = 400px, 4rem = 800px and to get the resulting font size, simply multiple 200px (the base font-size) by 4 which is 800px.</p>

                <p class="title">New Features in CSS3</p>
                <article>
                    <p>In this blog the new features that has been introduced in CSS3 (short for Cascading Style Sheet) is discussed briefly. In many ways CSS3 is an improvement on CSS2. It has been split into different sections, called modules. These modules make its way through the W3C in various stages of the recommendation process. </p>
                    <p>In CSS3, three new additional attribute selectors has been introduced that were not possible in CSS2. Such as attribute beginning ending matches exactly, attribute ending matches exactly, and attribute contains the match.</p>
                    <p>In CSS3, 16 new psudo-classes have been introduces. Some of theme are :root, :nth-child(n), :nth-last-child(n), :last-child, :first-of-type, :only-child, :target, :enabled, :disabled and checked. A lot of these psuedo classes save the developer from giving id and classes to every elements. And some of them gives an opportunity to manipulate elements that was not easily achiveable.</p>
                    <p>In CSS3, several new properties has been introduced. Some of these are border-radius or box-shadow, flexbox and css-grid are newly introduced properties. And a new background style properties has also been introduced such as background-clip, background-origin and background-size.</p>
                    <p>In CSS3, as discussed above modules has been introduced. Modules that were incorporated into CSS3, and provides new features are described below.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Template layout module and CSS3 Grid positioning module has been introduced for creating grids with CSS.</li>
                        <li>Text module has been introduced to outline text and even create drop-shadows with CSS.</li>
                        <li>Color module's opacity attribute has been introduced to manipulate transparency of elements.</li>SS
                        <li>User Interface module has introduce new features. Such as new cursors, responses to actions, required fields, and even resizing elements.</li>
                        <li>Media Queries has been introduced that allows more flexibility when defining how a style sheet should be used. For instance, define a style sheet that is only for handheld devices that have a viewport larger than 20em.</li>
                        <li>Ruby (small annotations on top of or next to words) module has been introduced, which provides support for languages that use textual ruby to annotate documents.CSS3 Paged Media module has been introduced for even more support for paged media (paper, transparencies, etc).</li>
                        <li>Generated content has been introduced, such as running headers and footers, footnotes, and other content that is generated programmatically, especially for paged media.</li>
                        <li>CSS3 Speech module has also been introduced.</li>
                    </ul>
