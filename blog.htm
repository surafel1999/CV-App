                <p class="title">Using Scalable Units for Responsive Site.</p>
                <article>
                    <p>
                    	Does using units such as $, em, rem increase site responsiveness? Yes, it does. Because %, em, rem all are scalable units which are translated by the user's browser into pixel values. Since, these are scalable units values are not always exactly the same pixel, which depends on the current browser setting.</p>
					<p>
                        Therefore, if the user wants to increase the size of the text, this can be done simply by using relative size on the developer's part and the browser handles the rest. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    	Furthermore, when websites are developed it should target many devices specially, mobile phones. In a nutshell, in this era of technology no matter what the device, the website should look great. This is done by using relative size.

                <p class="title">The defualt browser's font-size</p>
                <article>
                    <p>The defualt browser font-size also called base font-size is often 16px, which is the standard for proportional fonts. All scalable units are computed relative to this value. In other words, scalable units are proportional to the base font-size. Therefore, by default 1rem = 16px, and 2rem = 32px. 
                    </p>
                    <p>If one has set a font-size of 200px on the body, then all scalable units will be relative to this new value. For example, 1em will become 200px, 2rem = 400px, 4rem = 800px and to get the resulting font size, simply multiple 200px (the base font-size) by 4 which is 800px.</p>

                <p class="title">New Features in CSS3</p>
                <article>
                    <p>In this blog the new features that has been introduced in CSS3 (short for Cascading Style Sheet) is discussed briefly. In many ways CSS3 is an improvement on CSS2.

                    <p>In CSS3, 16 new psudo-classes have been introduces. Some of theme are :root, :nth-child(n), :nth-last-child(n), :last-child, :first-of-type, :only-child, :target, :enabled, :disabled and checked. A lot of these psuedo classes save the developer from giving id and classes to every elements. And some of them gives an opportunity to manipulate elements that was not easily achiveable.</p>
                    <p>In CSS3, several new properties has been introduced. Some of these are border-radius or box-shadow, flexbox and css-grid are newly introduced properties. And a new background style properties has also been introduced such as background-clip, background-origin and background-size.</p>
                    <p>In CSS3, as discussed above modules has been introduced. Modules that were incorporated into CSS3, and provides new features are described below.</p>

                        <li>Media Queries has been introduced that allows more flexibility when defining how a style sheet should be used. For instance, define a style sheet that is only for handheld devices that have a viewport larger than 20em.</li>
                        <li>Ruby (small annotations on top of or next to words) module has been introduced, which provides support for languages that use textual ruby to annotate documents.CSS3 Paged Media module has been introduced for even more support for paged media (paper, transparencies, etc).</li>
